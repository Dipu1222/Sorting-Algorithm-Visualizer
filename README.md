# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A Java-based GUI application that visualizes various sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Heap Sort. This project aims to help users understand how these sorting algorithms work by providing real-time visual feedback.
# Features
* Visualization of Sorting Algorithms: Watch how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step.
* Array Generation: Generate arrays of different sizes for sorting.
* Customization: Change the background color and graph color.
* Control Sorting Speed: Adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.
* Pause and Resume: Control the sorting process with pause and resume functionality.
# Algorithms Implemented
